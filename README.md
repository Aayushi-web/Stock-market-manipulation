# 🚀 Pump & Dump Detection in Indian Stock Market



> 🔍 **Hackathon Project** — Detecting Stock Market Manipulation using Supervised Learning (Indian Market Focus)

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Pump-and-dump schemes artificially inflate stock prices through misleading information, followed by a rapid sell-off that harms retail investors.  
This project leverages **machine learning** to **detect suspicious trading activity** and help regulators/investors stay alert.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web App**: Streamlit
- **Data Source**: Publicly available stock data (Yahoo Finance)

---

## 📊 Results

- **Logistic Regression**:  
  - Accuracy: ~87%  
  - ROC-AUC: ~0.90  

- **Random Forest (Best Model)**:  
  - Accuracy: ~97%  
  - ROC-AUC: ~0.99  

✅ Random Forest significantly outperformed and was deployed in the web app.
